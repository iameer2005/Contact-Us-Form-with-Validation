# Contact-Us-Form-with-Validation
Contact Us Form â€“ Mini Project
This project is a basic Contact Us web form made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter their name, email, subject, and message, and then submit the form.

The form includes validation using JavaScript:

It checks that all fields are filled.

It makes sure the email is in the correct format.

It shows error messages if something is missing or wrong.

If everything is correct, it shows a thank-you message and clears the form.
